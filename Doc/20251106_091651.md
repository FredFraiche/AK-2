## Game Rules

You have a fleet of submarines hidden in 6 squares. A fleet of airplanes is searching for your submarines with sonar. Each airplane (dice roll) searches one square.

### Game Setup
- **Board:** 6 squares arranged in 2 rows of 3
- **Detection mechanism:** 6-sided die
- **Rounds:** Each game consists of 5 rounds

### Gameplay Flow

1. **Before each round:** All players predict how many submarines will be detected (number of unique squares hit)

2. **During the round:** 
   - Roll the die 6 times
   - Mark each square that gets "hit" by a roll
   - Same square can be hit multiple times, but only counts once

3. **After the round - Scoring:**
   - **4 points:** Prediction exactly matches actual hits
   - **2 points:** Prediction is ±1 from actual hits
   - **1 point:** Prediction is ±2 from actual hits
   - **0 points:** Prediction is off by more than ±2

4. **Winner:** Player with highest total score after 5 rounds

## Programming Requirements

Create a Python program that:

1. ✅ Uses a **two-dimensional list** for the board representation
2. ✅ Outputs the board state to the **terminal** after each round
3. ✅ Uses Python's **random module** for dice rolls
4. ✅ Tracks and displays **results** (predictions, actual hits, scores)
5. ✅ Stores results to a **JSON file** for analysis
6. ✅ Creates **matplotlib charts** showing:
   - Hit distribution from multiple simulations
   - Comparison of experimental vs theoretical probabilities

### Additional Requirements

- Program must be **playable** in the terminal
- Include a **probability simulator** that can run N games and calculate statistics
- Create a **web frontend** using React/Netlify to:
  - Allow users to play the game
  - Run probability simulations with custom iteration counts
  - Display results with interactive charts

## Probability Analysis

The game demonstrates **sampling without replacement** (dependent events):

- P(1st roll hits new square) = 6/6 = 100%
- P(2nd roll hits new square | 1 hit) = 5/6 ≈ 83.3%
- P(3rd roll hits new square | 2 hits) = 4/6 ≈ 66.7%
- And so on...

**Expected distribution peaks at 3-4 unique hits per round.**

Use **Stirling numbers of the second kind** for theoretical probability calculations.

## Deliverables

1. Python CLI game (playable with 1-10 players)
2. Probability simulator with matplotlib visualizations
3. JSON data export functionality
4. React web application with:
   - Interactive game mode
   - Automated round simulator
   - Probability checker with statistics
5. Netlify deployment (live URL)
6. Complete documentation and verification scripts
