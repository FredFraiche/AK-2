KIUA1012. Machine Learning 1 – Fall 2025
Assignment 2: Submarine Game

Course Topics: Probability and Programming
Date and Location: Thursday, November 6th, 2025 – Biohus 2N1102
Time: 09:15–15:45 (attendance at 09:00)

This assignment includes both probability theory and programming.
The basis for the task is a submarine game.

In the first part of the assignment, you will work in groups to explore and analyze the submarine game (described in Appendix A).
This section includes:

Trying out the game.

Discussing and performing probability calculations.

Coding to simulate the game.

It is important that every group member takes notes from the group work.

In the second part of the assignment, you will work individually, using the experience, calculations, and code from the group work.
You will design a new variant of the submarine game and perform probability calculations and coding related to it.

The assignment must be submitted or demonstrated individually at the end of the work session.

EXECUTION
Part 1 – Group Work (09:15–12:15)

a) Play the game using the game board and dice.
Discuss the results and evaluate the likelihood of the different possible outcomes (subjective probability).

b) Discuss and evaluate the probability of the various outcomes and perform the necessary probability calculations (theoretical probability).

c) Create a Python program that simulates the submarine game.
Use the code to run multiple simulations of the game (experimental probability).
Compare the results with your evaluations in point b.
If necessary, perform new theoretical probability calculations.
(See the Programming Requirements section below.)

Part 2 – Individual Work (12:15–15:45)

d) Write a summary of your work from Part 1.
You must include relevant probability calculations and code from the group work.

e) Now create your own version of the submarine game, with new rules.
For example, you can:

Use a grid with more or fewer cells

Allow multiple dice to be rolled in each game

Describe your modified submarine game and perform steps b–c again with your version.

Programming Requirements

Create a game board using a two-dimensional list.

Print the state of the board to the terminal (use print).

Use Python’s random module to simulate dice rolls:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

Keep track of the results of the game.

Think about how to store the results for later analysis.

Plot the results of the game using Matplotlib:

https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/bar_colors.html

Programming Tips

Use stub functions in Python to create a prototype of the game.

Refactor your code by dividing it into functions, for example:

create_board()

display_board()

roll_dice()

Think about which parameters and return values each function should have.

(You do not need to use object-oriented programming for this assignment.)

Approval of Assignment 2 – Individual Work

The assignment is approved at the end of the work session (by 15:30) in one of two ways:

You show and explain your code and probability calculations to the instructor.

You submit a document in Canvas containing your code and probability calculations, with explanations.

The instructor will either approve your work or ask you to make improvements based on method 1 or 2.

Appendix A: The Submarine Game
1	2	3
4	5	6

There is one submarine in each of the six squares.
The Sonar Cruiser tries to find the submarines using sonar.
Sonar performs six searches.
You must try to predict how many of the six submarines will be detected.

Prediction

Before starting the simulation, try to predict how many submarines will be detected.
Each player writes their prediction in the score table.

Sonar Search Simulation

Roll a standard die (values 1–6).

The number indicates which submarine is detected by Sonar.

Draw a line through the middle of the square with that number.

If that square already has a line, roll again and make a new search.

Repeat until you have made exactly six searches.

All players record the number of hits in the score table and calculate the difference between their prediction and the actual number of hits.

Scoring System
Difference	Points
Exact match	4 points
±1 difference	2 points
±2 difference	1 point
More than ±2	0 points
Total Score

Repeat until you have played five rounds with Sonar and sum up your points for all rounds.
The winner of the Submarine Game is the player with the highest total score after five rounds.

Reflection and Discussion

Are the results surprising?

Which number of hits is most and least likely?

What is the probability that all six submarines are detected?

What is the best strategy to achieve the highest score?
