create a python program that runs this game, I need to be able to play it and run it for a given multiple of times to check the probability, follow the rules of the assignment, then use netlify to create a react front end for this program, one part of the webb app is to be a probability checker for this uboat game wheree the user can type in a random number of times the game is to run and then through the math mentioned and the python backend give detailed probability and statistics in a list and graph display. The other part of this web app is to be a way for the user to play the game, it needs to have a add player button, that adds a filed where the player enter his name, then a coin flip, heads or tail for who starts (add a small probability print to that as well for flair) it needs to render the board, then let the user press the boards 1,2,3,4,5,6 squares, this is how the user will set the amount and number for what he thinks the dice will land on. The user's input here needs to be shown in the game board squre for fir each user by a colored name appearin in the square the user selected, then user 2 does the same and so on, until all the users have selected which square nuber they think will be hit (number of hits) then a Roll the dice message appears and the user can interact with a Dice that spins and generates a number between 1 and 6, the result from this marks the related game board square with a hit, after 6 rolls of the dice, the scores are calculated. Even in the game part of this, the probability of the result is to be calculated.

Create a plan.md doc where we implement this stage wise.

The python program also needs to be able to be ran in the CLI and produce the game there, using the assigned rules.
